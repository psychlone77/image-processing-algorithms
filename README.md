## Introduction

Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to enhance it or extract useful information. This repository includes implementations of various image processing algorithms, such as filtering, edge detection, and contrast enhancement.

## Algorithms

The repository includes the following algorithms:

1. **Linear Filtering**: Applying different filters to an image to enhance or detect features.
2. **Edge Detection**: Detecting edges in an image using filters like Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny.
3. **Contrast Enhancement**: Enhancing the contrast of an image using linear and non-linear techniques.
4. **Histogram Equalization**: Improving the contrast of an image by equalizing its histogram.
5. **Image Smoothing**: Reducing noise in an image using techniques like Gaussian blur and median filtering.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
